# Welcome to Qatskills!

Qatskills is a blog designed to help classical logic and hardware engineers transition into quantum computing.

## What You'll Learn
- Reversible logic and quantum arithmetic
- Quantum Fourier Transform and linear algebra
- Matrix methods and real-world quantum applications

## There Will be Math

There will be math equations like $E = mc^2$ and $|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$ and
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
and
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H} |\psi(t)\rangle.
$$

## Something Interesting

Have you heard of the Mike and Ike book? *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen & Chuang is considered the gold standard reference for quantum computing.
